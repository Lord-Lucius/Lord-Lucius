## 💡 42 School Projects
🔹 **Libft**  
Language: C  
A custom library that re-implements standard C functions like `strlen`, `calloc`, and `strlcpy`. Helped me understand memory management and the fundamentals of C.

🔹 **ft_printf**  
Language: C  
My own version of the `printf` function. It was a great challenge to handle format specifiers, flags, and precision while maintaining flexibility.

🔹 **get_next_line**  
Language: C  
A function that reads a line from a file descriptor. I learned about dynamic memory allocation and buffer management for efficient reading.

🔹 **Born2beroot**  
Language: Shell / Virtualization  
A system administration project where I configured a virtual machine, managed users, and implemented security policies — my first deep dive into Linux systems.

🔹 **Minitalk**  
Language: C  
Minitalk is a small IPC project where you build a client and server that communicate using Unix signals to transmit strings.

🔹 **Push_swap**  
Language: C  
An algorithmic project that sorts a stack of integers using the fewest moves possible. It strengthened my understanding of sorting and optimization algorithms.

🔹 **Philosophers**  
Language: C  
Based on the "Dining Philosophers" problem. I dealt with threads, mutexes, and concurrency challenges — my introduction to synchronization and multithreading.

🔹 **Minishell**  
Language: C  
A miniature shell inspired by Bash. It handles command parsing, process management, and built-in commands like `cd`, `echo`, and `export`.  

🔹 **ft_irc**
Language: C++
An IRC server implementation following the RFC specifications. It manages client connections, channels, message routing, and supports essential IRC commands like JOIN, PART, PRIVMSG, and NICK.
